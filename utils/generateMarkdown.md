## Description
The professional README generator allows users to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application. It lets the project creator devote more time to working on their project. The README generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Installation
Since the README generator is a command-line application, I would recommend running it in your code editor. Clone the repo, and open the code in the code editor, and follow the terminal instructions.
## Usage
Please see a screenshot of the app's functionality below. The application is invoked by using the following command in the terminal: node index.js. The terminal will present a number of prompts. After user provides answers to the prompts, a markdown file will be generated in their code editor. The newly generated file reflects user's responses and styles them in the format of a professional README.
